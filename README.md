## Schedule

### Weeks 1 - 4

Planning and Research - We will brainstorm possible designs, find our customer, and establish goals. Research the materials we need and decide on our method to create each design part. Research wind speeds and park locations.

### Weeks 4 - 8 

Prototyping - We will create a quick, scaled-down version of the project to serve as a proof of concept. Possibly make multiple prototypes.

Initial Development - Begin CAD design of the parts we will 3-D print or laser cut. Create pseudo code and order the needed parts.

### Weeks 10 - 16 

Assembly - Assemble the wind turbine at CHS and do initial testing to ensure everything works.

### Weeks 16 - 20

Testing - Test at CHS and make any changes to the code or design we need. Collect data on energy production. Optimization.

### Weeks 20 - 22

Iterate - Place wind turbine in Greenleaf Park and collect data. Create a presentation for the UVA link lab.
