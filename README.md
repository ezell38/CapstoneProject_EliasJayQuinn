## Planning  

### Materials 

#### Bought

 - Synchronous Motor - 38$
 - Voltage regulator x3 - 3$ 
 - One-way voltage diode x3 - 5$
 - Rechargeable 5V Battery - 10-20$

#### From the Lab

 - 3D printed parts 
 - Pico+circuitry
 - PVC piping
 - Wood

### Requirements 

#### Essential

- Generate energy starting at wind speeds of 5 mph
- Average 10 Watts of energy production per hour
- Constant stream of power to an outlet  
- Firm base that does not require groundwork 
- Fits within 100 cubic feet
- Built with cheap, sustainable materials

#### Non-Essential

- Easily collapsible/can be transported easily
- Able to mount on rooftops to better use wind and not take up space
- Aesthetically pleasing design - Wonâ€™t look incredibly out of place in the park


## Schedule

### Weeks 1 - 4

Planning and Research - We will brainstorm possible designs, find our customer, and establish goals. Research needed materials and decide on our method to create each design part. Research wind speeds and park locations.

### Weeks 4 - 8 

Prototyping - We will create a quick, scaled-down version of the project to serve as a proof of concept. Possibly make multiple prototypes.

Initial Development - Begin CAD design of the parts we will 3-D print or laser cut. Create pseudo code and order the needed parts.

### Weeks 10 - 16 

Assembly - Assemble the wind turbine at CHS and do initial testing to ensure everything works.

### Weeks 16 - 20

Testing - Test at CHS and make any changes to the code or design we need. Collect data on energy production. Optimization.

### Weeks 20 - 22

Iterate - Place wind turbine in Greenleaf Park and collect data. Create a presentation for the UVA link lab.

### Week Summary 

Week 1 - Oct 29 - Nov 4 - 

This week we researched and ordered our charge controller. This device will assist with the circuitry by allowing us to monitor and control the voltage being produced by the system.

We also communicated with our mentor, Zack Landsman, and got one of his mass-produced small-scale wind turbine. We assembled this wind turbine and once the charge controller arrives will begin to produce energy and finalize our circuitry which we will implement after creating our large-scale turbine.
